	<h1>Well, actually I'll add some CSS, otherwise that's truly ugly.</h1>
	<p>Let's work on it <br/>
		Frist, I remember that, for your website to be found on google and others website of that kind, you'd better use em, strong and mark </p>

		<ul>
			<li>em is to show... hum, <em>like that</em> </li>
			<li> strong is, hum let's say <strong> like this</strong></li>
			<li> finnaly mark is <mark>mark</mark></li>
		</ul>
	<p> that was easy, to emphasis on some word, but, how to visually emphasize, for this, let's use some CSS </p>

	<p> I was tzalking of some CSS, yeah </p>
	<div id="CSS1">
		CSS 1
	</div>
	<div id="CSS2">
		CSS 2
	</div>
	<div id="CSS3"> 
	CSS 3</div>
	<div id="CSS4">
		CSS4
	</div>
